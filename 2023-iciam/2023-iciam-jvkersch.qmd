## What are feedback integrators?

Ingredients:

- Dynamical system $\dot{x} = X(x)$
- Constraint $V(x(t)) = 0$

**Problem**: Numerical dynamics will drift away from $V^{-1}(0)$.

**Feedback approach**: Make $V^{-1}(0)$ into an **attracting** invariant manifold (approximately conserved).

## How are feedback integrators implemented?

Add **restoring force** and consider
$$
    \dot{x} = X(x) - \alpha \nabla V(x).
$$

Under modest assumptions,

- $\nabla V(x)$ pulls dynamics back to $V^{-1}(0)$
- Dynamics on $V^{-1}(0)$ are not changed

Now, use *any standard integrator* to numerically integrate the modified vector field.

## What is the Dirac bracket?


## Practical advantages

Is it more accurate than a custom integrator? **No**

Is it more versatile than any specific integrator? **Yes**


straightforward modification of force field
