## Introduction

Work done in collaboration with Dong Eui Chang (KAIST) and Matthew Perlmutter (xxx)



## Ghent University Global Campus

quick overview


## What are feedback integrators? (Chang et al, 2017)

## What is the Dirac bracket?


## Practical advantages

Is it more accurate than a custom integrator? **No**

Is it more versatile than any specific integrator? **Yes**


straightforward modification of force field


##

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis

from helpers import include_shiny_folder
include_shiny_folder("feedback-integrators")
    
```
